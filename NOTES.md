# My Course Reflection

## What I Learned
- I now understand how to use `git commit -m "message"` to save my work.
- I learned the difference between a local and remote repository.
- I learned the difference between fork and clone repository.

## Areas I'm Still Confused About
- Merging repositories.
- Giving access to contributors as team lead to edit the issues and etc.
